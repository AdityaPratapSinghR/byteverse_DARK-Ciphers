## Motivation

The motivation behind StudyTube is to provide students with a distraction-free environment for focused learning, leveraging curated educational content from YouTube. As you know millions of students are learning from YouTube as it is one of the biggest platform that provides content for free. But it has a huge downside "**Distractions**".
If a student makes his mind to study and opens the app and the first video he sees is a comedy sketch and thinks okay let me just watch this video and he sees it, gets the dopamine boost and continues watching and without realising it has wasted 3-4 or even more hours of his day. So in order 
to prevent this from happening to us and those millions of student we made this app.

## Objectives

2. **Personalised educational content**. 
3. **User-friendly Interfaces**.
